Hello, I'm Bri

During my first job out of college, I was handed our WordPress site to manage as one of my many responsibilities. It was something that I picked up very quickly and enjoyed doing so I've decided to make a career change and pursue web development/design as a full time job!

Outside of work, my husband and I take care of our fur-child golden retriever, Dax. Big fan of long walks and breakfast food.
